\section*{Teaching Experience}

\noindent
I have taught and continue to teach both physics and astronomy undergraduate courses
and laboratories. The below listed assignments reflect GTA positions; however, while
at the University of Louisville I was in fact the instructor of record for the
Fundamentals of Physics lab and was responsible for the course itself. Further, I
have also managed a distance education class online for the Elementary Astronomy
Laboratory.
